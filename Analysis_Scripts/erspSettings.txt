finding closest frequencies: 970 freqs removed
Computing the mean baseline spectrum
Note: Add output variables to command line call in history to
      retrieve results and use the tftopo function to replot them
Warning: 'nfreqs' input overwrite 'padratio'
Computing Event-Related Spectral Perturbation (ERSP) and
  Inter-Trial Phase Coherence (ITC) images based on 1 trials
  of 48725 frames sampled at 250 Hz.
Each trial contains samples from 0 ms before to
  194896 ms after the timelocking event.
  Image frequency direction: normal
Using hanning FFT tapering
Warning: 4 out of 195 time values were removed (now 2002.00 to 192002.00 ms) so the lowest
         frequency could be computed with the requested accuracy
Finding closest points for time variable
Time values for time/freq decomposition is not perfectly uniformly distributed
The window size used is 1000 samples (4000 ms) wide.
Estimating 30 linear-spaced frequencies from 1.0 Hz to 30.0 Hz.
